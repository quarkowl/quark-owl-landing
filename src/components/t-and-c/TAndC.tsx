          If you choose to enter into an agreement with us, we will process your
          personal data to the extent necessary to carry out the processing.
          This applies both to contracts concluded within the framework of
          providing services by electronic means (e.g. sending a newsletter) and
          to cooperation contracts or provision of services. If in connection
          with the contract concluded (Article 6.1(b) GDPR) it appears necessary
          for us to process personal data which have been made available or
          entrusted to you (the data of your Customers), we shall conclude with
          you an appropriate data protection agreement (DPA), which shall
          constitute a legal basis for the processing of such data by us.
        </span>
        <span >
          We shall retain the personal data provided to us under the contract
          for the contract duration and also on its termination for the

            <li>
              or a maximum of the limitation periods provided for by law after
              the contract termination.
            </li>
          </span>
        </ul>
        <span >
          Additionally, the law (Article 6.1(c) GDPR) requires us to process
          your data for tax and accounting purposes. We will retain this
          information for as long as required by law.
        </span>
        <span >
          If you give your consent (Article 6.1(a) GDPR), we will process your

        </ul>
        <span >
          We will retain personal data collected based on your consent until it
          is revoked or the purpose it was processed for has been achieved or
          until it becomes obsolete. You can withdraw your consent to the
          processing of personal data at any time by sending an e-mail.

        <span className={"tcHeader"}>To whom can we share the data?</span>

          the data, such as hosting providers, cloud computing providers,

          You are entitled to certain rights, including:
        </span>

        <ul>
          <span >
            <li>
              <strong>the right to access your data - </strong> i.e. the right
              to obtain confirmation from the QuarkOwl as to whether or not your
              personal data is being processed by us, or to obtain a copy of
              your personal data. This is to ensure that you are aware of and
              able to check how the QuarkOwl uses your personal data. We may
              refuse to provide a copy of your personal information where this
              could adversely affect the rights of another person;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>the right to rectification - </strong> i.e. the right to
              request the QuarkOwl to rectify any personal data that is
              inaccurate or incomplete without delay (e.g. where the QuarkOwl
              processes your incorrect name or address);
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>
                the right to delete your data (also known as the “right to be
                forgotten”) -{' '}
              </strong>
              it enables you to request the deletion of your personal data if,
              for example, your data was used illegally, or your consent was
              withdrawn (if it was the only reason for processing your data).
              However, the “right to be forgotten” does not constitute an
              absolute right to erasure of personal data as there are certain
              exceptions to this right, e.g. where we still need to use the data
              to establish, pursue or defend legal claims or to fulfill a legal
              obligation (e.g. under accounting or tax law);
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>the right to restrict processing - </strong> you have the
              right to prevent us from further using your personal data if, for
              example, the QuarkOwl is in the process of evaluating a request
              for rectification of your data. If the processing of personal data
              is restricted, QuarkOwl may still store your personal data, but
              may not further actively use it (e.g. for the purpose of
              fulfilling a contract).
